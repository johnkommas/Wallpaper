# Sound Pack

## Overview
The **Sound Pack** folder contains audio files used in the application for sound effects or background music. These files add an enhanced audio experience for the users.

## Contents
1. `a.mp3` - *(Description: Provide details about what this sound is used for, e.g., "Button click sound.")*
2. `b.mp3` - *(Description: Provide details, e.g., "Error notification sound.")*
3. `c.mp3` - *(Description: Provide details, e.g., "Background music or success notification.")*

## Integration with Pygame
The sounds in this folder are managed using the `pygame` library. Below are usage examples:

### Loading and Playing Sounds
You can load and play these sounds in your application like this:
```python
import pygame
pygame.mixer.init()

# Load the sound files
sound_a = pygame.mixer.Sound("a.mp3")
sound_b = pygame.mixer.Sound("b.mp3")
sound_c = pygame.mixer.Sound("c.mp3")

# Play the sounds
sound_a.play()
sound_b.play()
sound_c.play()
```

### Using Background Music
To use a sound file as background music:
```python
pygame.mixer.music.load("c.mp3")  # Load background music
pygame.mixer.music.play(-1)       # Play in an infinite loop
```

## Notes
1. The **Sound Pack** folder must remain in its correct location relative to the Python script for the sounds to load properly.
2. Ensure that Pygame is installed and initialized before using these audio files:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. `.mp3` compatibility may depend on your version of Pygame and the system configuration. For best results, use `.wav` if compatibility issues arise.
